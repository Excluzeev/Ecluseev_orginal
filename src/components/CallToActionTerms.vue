    <li><strong> &lsquo;Call to Action&rsquo; Agreement</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Platform enables Content Creators to crowd-fund the production of new Content by starting a &lsquo;Call to Action&rsquo; Channel on the Platform. A &lsquo;Call to Action&rsquo; Channel is an offer from a Channel Creator to other Platform Users to support the creation of proposed content by making a donation. When a Donor donates money to a &lsquo;Call to Action&rsquo;, a legally binding agreement is formed between that Channel Creator and the Donor (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Call to Action Agreement&rdquo;). The Company will not be a Party to any Call to Action Agreements, and all Call to Action Agreements are between the Donors and Channel Creators only.</span></p>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CHANNEL CREATOR&rsquo;S - RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</strong></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Call to Action Channel Creator is obliged to provide a detailed description of the Content that they would like to produce (“the Content”), the amount of money they wish to raise (“target amount”), setting up one or more donation tiers and clearly specifying what a Donor will receive in exchange for making a donation under a specific donation tier. We encourage Channel Creators to provide a realistic estimated delivery date for any Commitment you make under a donation tier</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Channel Creator is only eligible to receive the donations from a Call to Action once the target amount is successfully raised. Please note, a Channel Creator is under a legal obligation to only use donations from a Call to Action to produce the Content described by them on their Call to Action and to fulfil their Commitment towards their Donors.</span></p> 

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event a Channel Creator is unable to produce the Content and/or fulfil his/her Commitment towards Donors, such Channel Creator must communicate the situation to the Donors without undue delay. The Channel Creator must either propose alternative ways that s/he will attempt to create the proposed Content and fulfil the Commitments towards Donors, or if it is impossible to fulfil the Commitment, refund all remaining donations to the Donors in proportion to their initial donation.</span></p> 

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Channel Creator must make his/her best effort to offer Donors complete transparency during the Call to Action Agreement on how the funds have been used and what steps the Channel Creator has taken to fulfil his/her Commitments.</span></p>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DONOR&rsquo;S - RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</strong>
  </span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you donate to a Call to Action on the Platform, you understand that you do so entirely at your own risk. A Call to Action offer carries the same risks as any other business venture. There are no guarantees that the Channel Creator will achieve the target amount, the proposed Content will be completed within the indicated timeline, the end Content will meet your expectations or that the Channel Creator will be able to deliver upon his/her Commitment for your donation tier. You understand that any delivery date specified on the Donation Tiers is the Channel Creator’s estimated delivery date and there are no guarantees that the Channel Creator will be able to fulfil the Commitment by that date.</span> </p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also understand and accept that there may be circumstances when the Channel Creator will contact you directly to request any additional information needed to deliver upon their Commitment under a Call to Action Agreement. You have the right to decline any request for information from a Channel Creator. However, you understand and accept that if you decline to provide information that is necessary for the Channel Creator to fulfil their Commitment to you, you will not be able to assert any claims against the Channel Creator at a later date.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You further understand and accept that the Content Creator is solely responsible for fulfilling his/her Commitments to you, and the Company will not be responsible for any loss incurred by you as a result of Channel Creator’s failure to fulfil any obligations under any Call to Action Agreement. By donating to any Call to Action on the Platform, you expressly release the Company from all liability arising from or related to such Call to Action Agreement.</span></p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <ol start="5">
    <li><strong> Donations</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DONORS</span></p>
  
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you make a Donation, your full donation amount will be subject to a fixed Service Fee (10%) , and 2.9% plus C$0.30 (“transaction fees”) charged by Stripe, our preferred payment processor. You understand and acknowledge that the Company is not acting as a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor or a registered Charity and your donations will not be tax-deductible. All donations will be processed like an ordinary payment. When you donate money on the Platform, you authorize the Company to charge your selected payment method for the full donation amount specified on your selected donation tier. Please note that your payment method will only be charged when a Call to Action reaches the target amount. If a Call to Action does not raise the target amount within the specified deadline, your payment method will not be charged. If you change your mind and you no longer wish to support the Call to Action, you may cancel your donation at least 72 hours before the specified deadline for the Call to Action.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company does not offer any refunds in the event of a Channel Creator’s failure to deliver the proposed Content and/or any other Commitment to you as a Donor.</span></p> 
  <p><br /></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHANNEL CREATORS</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your Call to Action reaches the target amount, our payment processor Stripe will charge the Donor’s payment method for the full donation amount specified on their selected donation tier. Although we will make our best effort to transfer all donations raised by your Call to Action less the Service Fee (10%) and Transaction fees (2.9% plus C$0.30 per transaction) into your account, we are unable to offer any guarantees. You should not make any decisions or incur any liabilities that require the availability of the donation amount in your account until all amounts have been successfully paid into your account.</span> </span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that neither the Company nor Stripe will be held liable for any payments that cannot be processed for any reason.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you receive the donations, you may choose to refund a Donor should you wish to do so. Please note that issuing a refund will terminate the Call to Action between the Channel Creator and the Donor and neither party will have any other rights or obligations against each other</span></p> 

  <p><br /></p>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #333333;"><strong>Chargebacks</strong></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a donation is disputed by the cardholder, reversed by our payment processor, or the transaction is otherwise suspected to be illegal, such donation will be reversed.</span></p> 

  <p><br /></p>

  <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Company&rsquo;s liability for &ldquo;chargebacks&rdquo;</i></span></em></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not assume any liability for any losses a Channel Creator may incur as a result of any chargebacks, fraudulent charges, actions that are deemed to be illegal or in violation of these Terms and Conditions by the Company in its sole discretion (“Illegal activity”). You hereby release the Company from any liability arising from or associated with any such illegal activity.</span></p> 

  <p><br /></p>

  <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company&rsquo;s collection rights</span></em></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a donation amount has already been transferred to your account at the time of Chargeback, the Company reserves the right to debit the chargeback amount as well as any other fees/ penalties incurred for such chargeback from your credit card.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be liable for the payment of any Chargebacks related to the donations on your Call to Action, and you agree to make full payment upon requests.</span></p>

  <p><br /></p>

  <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspicious account activity</span></em></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event we observe that there have been multiple chargebacks on your Call to Action or we observe any suspicious activity linked to your Call to Action, we may take any appropriate measures to protect our Users and our Platform including but not limited to terminating such User account.</span></p>
